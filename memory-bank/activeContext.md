# Active Context

## Current State
✅ **MongoDB replica set fully operational** with 25,500 reviews loaded
✅ **CSV data integration working** - all properties from cleaned_airbnb_data.csv processed
✅ **Comment cycling implemented** - 5 predefined comments rotating across properties
✅ **Data structure cleaned** - removed comment_type field from review documents

## Recent Changes

### Latest Session (Current)
- **Removed comment_type field** from MongoDB review documents
- **Simplified document structure** to core review data only
- **Updated memory bank** with comprehensive project documentation

### Previous Sessions
- **Fixed CSV loading issue** - replaced `cat` with `fs.readFileSync()`
- **Implemented cycling comments** - 5 comment types rotating across all properties
- **Scaled to full dataset** - processing all 25,500 properties instead of sample data
- **Optimized review generation** - one review per property instead of 5 per property

## Current Focus
The system is now production-ready with a clean, efficient data structure:
- One review per property (25,500 total)
- Exact CSV ratings preserved (0-100 scale)
- Cycling comment patterns for variety
- No tracking fields needed (comment_type removed)

## Next Steps
System is complete and functional. Potential areas for future work:
- Analytics queries and aggregations
- Additional review generation patterns
- Performance optimization for larger datasets
- Integration with frontend analytics dashboard

## Key Learnings
1. **MongoDB shell limitations** - `cat` command not available, use Node.js `fs` module
2. **Container orchestration** - proper health checks essential for initialization order
3. **Data consistency** - preserving exact CSV values more valuable than artificial variation
4. **Clean architecture** - removing unnecessary tracking fields improves data model simplicity
